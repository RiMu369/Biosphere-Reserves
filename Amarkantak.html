The natural vegetation in the Achanakmar-Bilaspur Biosphere Reserve varies across the reserve. The forest area of the reserve has tropical deciduous vegetation and it can be classified into Northern Tropical Moist Deciduous and Southern Dry Mixed Deciduous forests. The reserve is quite rich in plant diversity, having a combination of different climatic and edaphic conditions at various altitudes. The region provides shelter to various thallophyte, bryophyte, pteridophyte, gymnosperm, and angiosperm species. Almost 1500 plant species representing over 151 plant families can be found in the reserve. Several angiosperm species are found in the Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve. Some of the important species include Thalictrum sp., Dillenia pentagyna, Cocculus hirsutus, Flacourtia indica, Talinium portulacifolium, Tamarix ericoides, Abelmoschus ficulneus, Hibiscus subdariffa, Corchorus fascicularis, Grewia rothii, Biophytum sp., Oxalis sp., Tropaeolum majus, Gloriosa superba, Curcuma aromatica, Dioscore sp., Chlorophytum tuberosum, Curculigo orchioides, and Hypercum japonicum. Many planted gymnosperms have also been localized in the Amarkantak plateau and have adapted to the local environmental conditions of the area. Some of them are considered as endemic species; these include Cupressus torulosa, Thuja orientalis, Araucaria bidwillii, Pinus caribaea, Pinus elliottii, P. gregaii, P. kesiya, P. mountzumae, Pinus oocarpa, Pinus patula, Pinus ponderosa, Pinus pseudostrobus, Pinus roxburghii, Pinus serotina, Cedrus deodara, Juniperus sp., and Taxodium sp.

The faunal composition of the Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve is quite rich. More diverse and flourishing populations of wildlife can be found in the Achanakmar Sanctuary than in any other reserved forest area-including the Biosphere Reserve. The main reason for this is better protection and improved habitat conditions in the Sanctuary, due to strict conservation actions. According to the 2004 census, the Achanakmar Sanctuary is home to 26 tigers, 46 panthers, 28 bears, 1936 Chitals, 1369 sambars, 376 barking deers and 552 bison (gaur). Other important fauna species found in the reserve include the blackbuck, chinkara, wolves, foxes, Jackals, wild boar, monkeys samarth and giant squirrels. Besides the rich variety of mammal fauna species, the reserve also provides natural habitat to 170 bird species belonging to 51 families. More than 13 species of snakes and lizards, along with several species of frogs (cricket frog, burrowing frog, tree frog, ornate narrow mouthed frog, toad, bullfrog , etc.) are found in the reserve as well.
