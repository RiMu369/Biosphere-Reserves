# Biosphere-Reserves
The Biosphere Explorer project is a web-based platform developed to provide an educational and engaging experience for users to learn about the country's biosphere reserves while fostering awareness of biodiversity conservation. The central feature of the project is an interactive map that allows users to visually explore the diverse network of biosphere reserves across India. Each reserve is marked on the map, enabling users to click and access detailed information about its location, significance, and unique ecosystems. This includes descriptions of various habitats such as forests, wetlands, and coastal areas, as well as information about the native flora and fauna, including endangered species found within the reserves.
The platform is designed with user engagement as a primary focus, incorporating a variety of interactive elements to create a dynamic and immersive learning experience. Clickable map markers provide users with information pages that offer insights into the history and information about the flora and fauna of each reserve, accompanied by visually appealing multimedia galleries that showcase stunning wildlife photography. These galleries bring the beauty of India's natural landscapes to life, making the learning experience more vivid and impactful.
