<p>
Biosphere reserves are ‘learning places for sustainable development’. They are sites for testing interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and managing changes and interactions between social and ecological systems, including conflict prevention and management of biodiversity. They are places that provide local solutions to global challenges. Biosphere reserves include terrestrial, marine and coastal ecosystems. Each site promotes solutions reconciling the conservation of biodiversity with its sustainable use.</p><p>
Biosphere Reserves involve local communities and all interested stakeholders in planning and management. They integrate three main "functions":
<ul>
<li>Conservation of biodiversity and cultural diversity
<li>Economic development that is socio-culturally and environmentally sustainable
<li>Logistic support, underpinning development through research, monitoring, education and training
</ul>
