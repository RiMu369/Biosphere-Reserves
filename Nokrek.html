</FONT>
</CENTER>
<p>Nokrek is the highest peak in West Garo Hills, and has a huge population of rare plants and animals. Some of them include a very rare species of citrus-indica, endemic to this place, which the locals call memang narang. Literally translated, it means the orange of the spirits. The park covers an area of about 47 sq km and has been listed as UNESCOâ€™s Biosphere Reserve. Abundant wildlife including herds of wild elephants, animal species like leopard, pangolin, hoolock gibbon, python, hornbill, besides rare orchids abound in the sanctuary. The last few red pandas of the world also call this place home. One can also spot bird species like hornbill, peacock and pheasant. Other attractions are the Simsang River Game Reserve, Ronbang Dare Waterfalls and the Nokrek Peak.</P>

<p>
The Nokrek Biosphere Reserve is located in the northeast of India on the Tura Range, which forms part of the Meghalaya Plateau (average altitude: 600 metres). The entire area is mountainous and Nokrek is the highest peak of the Garo hills, rising up 1,412 metres. The north of the reserve embraces rather gently undulating hills, while steep slopes characterize the south.

<p>
The Nokrek region has a remnant population of the red panda that has generated curiosity across the world, one of which was accidentally shot by Dr J. Lao in 1960s. However apart from that lone sighting, there has never been any more sightings of the red panda in recent years. The Nokrek area is also an important habitat of the Asian elephant. The park had eight species of cats, ranging from the Royal Bengal tiger to marbled cat but the current status of the first is uncertain. There are seven species of primates in Nokrek. The rare stump-tailed macaque is frequently seen near the main trek to the peak. The pig-tailed macaque also occurs. The Western Hoolock gibbon are common and their calls could be heard all over Nokrek. The Nokrek region is also an Important Bird Area. There is a vast range of plants found in the park. A huge canopy of thick, tall and lush green forests cover Nokrek and its environment. The mother germoplasm of Citrus indica (locally known as Memang Narang) have been discovered by science researchers within Nokrek Range. This discovery led to the establishment of the National Citrus Gene Sanctuary-cum-Biosphere Reserve covering an area of forty-seven square kilometres. The area has wild varieties of citrus fruits that provide a gene-pool for commercially produced citrus.
