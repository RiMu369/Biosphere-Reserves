<p>
Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve harbours more than 3,700 plant species, including about 200 medicinal plants; the 132 endemic flowering plants are contained in the list of endemic plants in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Stunted evergreen trees grow in shola forest patches above 1,800 m (5,900 ft) and are festooned with epiphytes. Tall trees above a height of 18 m (59 ft) are used by the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) for building nests, including the species Tetrameles nudiflora, Indian laurel (Ficus microcarpa), Coromandel ebony (Diospyros melanoxylon), yellow snake tree (Stereospermum tetragonum), rusty kamala (Mallotus tetracoccus) and Acrocarpus fraxinifolius.[10] During the peak flowering season from January to May, at least 73 species blossom including teak (Tectona grandis), red cedar (Erythroxylum monogynum), hiptage (Hiptage benghalensis), large-flowered bay tree (Persea macrantha), zunna berry (Ziziphus rugosa) and creeping smartweed (Persicaria chinensis). They depend on pollination by giant honey bee, Asiatic honey bee (Apis cerana), red dwarf honey bee (A. florea) and Trigona bees.
